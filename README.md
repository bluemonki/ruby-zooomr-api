# ruby-zooomr-api -- ARCHIVED

## What is it?
An implementation of the API for the photosharing service Zooomr (http://www.zooomr.com), this particular implementation is in Ruby

## What do I need to use it?
An API KEY!!
API keys can be created in your Zooomr account settings: http://www.zooomr.com/account/external_services/api/

Please use the API documentation which can be found here: http://trac.zooomr.com/trac/wiki/ZooomrAPI

## Got any help with using this thing??!
Also use the Zooomr_test.rb file for your reference, this file exercises all API calls currently availble - though not all options on those calls.

## The Future!
There are more API functions to come from Zooomr so check back soon for more exciting goodies :)
